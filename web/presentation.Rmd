# Today's agenda

- Assumed knowledge
- What are we doing
- Good resources
- Creating a bare-bones website
- Options for customization
- Deploying

# Assumed knowledge

- RMarkdowns (.Rmds)
  - Rmd syntax
- Git and GitHub
- Bonus: Any knowledge of web languages
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - This can be a great way to learn!

# What are we doing

- Goal: Understand the workflow of creating a website with Rmds and GitHub Pages

- In addition to being a great way to write [literate programs](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/literate-programming.html), Rmd supports a variety of output formats
  - Including HTML!
- We can use YAML + Rmds to build a website
  - YAML brings the organization
  - Rmds bring the content
- Bonus: We can add customizations
  - Themes
  - Custom stylesheets (CSS)
  - Custom HTML/Javascript

# Good resources

- [GitHub's GitHub Pages Overview](https://pages.github.com/)
- [rstudio4edu's RMarkdown Sites Cookbook](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/intro-rmd.html)
- [Emily Zabor's R Websites Tutorial](https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html#Types_of_websites)
- [The RMarkdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

# Creating a bare-bones website

We will need

- A YAML file
  - [From RedHat:](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml#:~:text=YAML%20is%20a%20human%2Dreadable,is%20for%20data%2C%20not%20documents.) YAML is a human-readable data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files.
  Depending on whom you ask, YAML stands for yet another markup language or YAML ainâ€™t markup language (a recursive
  acronym), which emphasizes that YAML is for data, not documents. 
- An index file
  - index.Rmd which will knit into index.html
  - Automatic homepage
  
From your \web directory\*, run `rmarkdown::render_site()` to autopopulate files

\* You will want to consider your directory structure (specific to project needs)

# Options for customization

- [RMarkdown Themes](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/)
- [Templates](https://github.com/topics/personal-website)
  - Some of these are [Jekyll themes](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll)
  - [Joanna's ancient site example](https://github.com/jo-schroeder/jo-schroeder.github.io)
- Inline CSS
- [Linked](https://github.com/uva-bi-sdad/sdc.intro/blob/main/src/web/_site.yml#L7) [CSS stylesheets](https://github.com/uva-bi-sdad/sdc.intro/blob/main/src/web/style.css)
- [Custom HTML](https://github.com/uva-bi-sdad/sdc.intro/blob/main/src/web/data.Rmd#L11)
- [Custom Javascript](https://github.com/uva-bi-sdad/sdc.intro/blob/main/src/web/health_equity_beta.Rmd#L1)

- Note: VERY HACKY

# Deploying

- Make sure your changes have been knit
  - Hint: Hit the hammer!
- Hosting with GitHub pages
  - Limited to one root site per organization or user, unlimited "project" sites
- From your repository Settings click Pages
  - Select Deploy from Branch (or GitHub Actions)
  - Select your main branch and \docs folder (where the knitted .html files live)
  - Here's where you can add a custom domain name
